# Project_ISYE6420
As part of ISYE6420 as an introduction to Bayesian Statistical Inference and applications, in this paper we define a state $\eta = \left\{ t,\sigma,r,S_{0} \right\}$. For this state, we apply a stochastic dynamic following the CRR parameterization rules with a specific case where $S_{0}=1$,  $\sigma=0.3$, $r=0.05$. With the model, we ran 1000 simulations where each simulation had $n=10000$ (number of trials) within the state.  As a core results we were able to calculate giving a target price ($K= 1.5$). That the probability $S_{f}> K$ is 0.084 and that for our case (large number of trials), we show that the binomial to normal distribution approximation is acceptable and that for $t=1$ we obtain $\mu_{dist.}=1.03$ and $\sigma_{dist.} = 0.32$. We also identified that $\sigma_{dist.}$ evolves with time getting larger behaving as a diffusion coefficient.
